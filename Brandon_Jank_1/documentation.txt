For now (until somebody finds out how to create man pages),
this will be the documentation.

==== General Operational Concept ====
First of all, this program binds to a port.

==== Directory Structure ====
This is not intended to explain the entire linux directory structure in
general.  For that, you have Google... and jank.  And experimental observation

V/etc/init.d/
 | BISON-Transfer							# This is the startup script
V/var/run/
 V BISON-Transfer
  V Images									# Directory storing taken images
   | ...
   | .Images.md5							# Dynamically Programming MD5's
  | BISON-Transfer.pid						# PID file for BISON-Transfer
  | BISON.cfg								# Dynamically synchronized config.

==== General Programming Tenets ====
These are probably not original ideas.  Brandon will try to follow these as
best he can.

It is the common goal of computer scientists and engineers alike to create
code that is portable and reusable... and to reuse code that works.

If something is written in a way that it cannot be redily understood at a
basic level by the reader, it becomes difficult to maintain.  Therefore,
the need comes to rewrite it... or at least call up the guy who wrote it.

First, get it working.  Second, get it working right.  Third, get it working
fast.
